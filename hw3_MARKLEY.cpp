// Description: print out a simple greeting message to the user when called (is called whenever the program opens)
// Pre: none
// Post: successful kind message is printed, returns nothing
void greet();

// Description: prints out the wordle menu options when called (is called when the user is selecting from the menu)
// Pre: none
// Post: successful wordle menu is printed, returns nothing
void printWordleMenu();

// Description: prints out the stats over all rounds played between the two players when chosen from the wordle menu, also can add 2 to their friendship level
// Pre: p1 must be player1name, p2 must be player2name, rounds must be roundCount, friendshipOld must be friendshipLevelOld
//      friendshipNew must be friendshipLevel | if these are not the called variables, the function WILL misbehave
// Post: game summary is successfully printed using the parameters, and friendship level may have been increased by 2, returns nothing
void printGameSummary(string p1, string p2, int rounds, int friendshipOld, int & friendshipNew);

// Description: prints out the words guessed in the last round using the symbols for each letter (^o^, ^-^, @.@). each line corresponds to a word attempt
// Pre: p1 must be player1name, p2 must be player2name, words must be wordleResults, rounds must be roundCount, and attempts must be attemptCount
//      if these are not the called variables, the function WILL misbehave
// Post: words guessed from last round are successfully printed out using the parameters, returns nothing.
